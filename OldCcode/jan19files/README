This files included here are my research up to January 19, 1995.

	The changes that exist here are as follows:
		-a working 3-D annealer with 5 components
		-a weight adjustment based on temperature (actually left from
			2-D model)
		-a normalization based on Simon's old normaliztion code
		-heat.app a program that attempts to simulate the penalties 
			produced by heat3D.c
		-much work was done on the LU-Decomp. in attempts to find
			a quicker way to solve it.  It didn't work.
